# Zalcano
Multi-purpose Zalcano Utilities for both casual players as well as pet hunters. The plugin shows the amount of players in the cave, Zalcano's current health, your damage dealt, wether you qualify for any reward and what your chances are of obtaining a tool seed.
## Scouting information
* If Zalcano is out of vision the health won't update, so be careful.
* The plugin doesn't rely on the health overlay option, but having it on makes the health indicator more accurate. See image below for the option:
