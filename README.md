# Zalcano

## Features
* Showing the amount of players in the cave.
* Showing Zalcano's current health (Both mining & throwing phase).
* Show your damage dealt and minimum damage needed (Both mining & throwing).

## Scouting information
* If Zalcano is out of vision the health won't update, so be careful.
* The plugin doesn't rely on the health overlay option, but having it on makes the health indicator more accurate. See the image below on how to enable this option:
